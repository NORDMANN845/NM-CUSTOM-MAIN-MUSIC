# NM-CUSTOM-MAIN-MUSIC

is a C# mod that lets you replace the main menu music in 7 Days to Die with any song you want. Switching the track is extremely easy and requires no coding knowledge.

The NordArmy main menu song is included as the example track.

Installation:

Extract the ZIP file.
Copy the folder NMMAINMUSIC into your Mods directory. You can place it in either location:

-AppData: C:\Users\<Name>\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods or
-Steam installation: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods

How to change the song:

-Your custom song must be a .wav file.
-Rename your file to: nmmainmusic
-Place it here: Mods\NMMAINMUSIC\Audio
-Start the game — your new track will now play in the main menu.

BTW:

It’s available for any modder to use whenever they need it.


Skål, NORDMANN
